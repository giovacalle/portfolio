# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This website is built with Astro.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS. I was curious about Astro.js, so what better way to learn than to build my own portfolio website with it?

## Technologies Used

- [Astro.js](https://astro.build/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

## Aim

The aim of this portfolio website is to showcase my skills and experience as a web developer. It includes information about my background, my education, my work experience, and my portfolio of projects. Visitors can also contact me through the website to discuss potential opportunities or just to say hello :)
